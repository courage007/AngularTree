# Ng2tree(an angular tree component) Manifesto
1 - Build a **Simple** and **Universal**  angular tree is No.1. What I want to in the beginning is 
to create a simple and universal tree. In order to achieving the goal, I prefer to only add necessary
function. As we all know, if we improve the Universality, it will complicate the component.So I need to
find rebalance in Simplicity and Universality.

# Code Development Plan ( CDP )
In order to develop a much more perfact tree, I collect demand from other public angular tree and my 
colleagues who need to use an angular tree component.
What's more, I make a develop plan to coding in order which is helpful for anyone who want to use this 
tree component.
## 1. Build a **mix** tree and publish the tree in npm way

## 2. Add CRUD(Create、Retrieve、Update、Delete) API

## 3. Add checkbox

## 4. Support to  CSS  adjusted api when expanding or collapsing the tree for developers

## 5. Support **dragable** (2018.06.28)

## 6. Add Right-click shortcut **ContextMenu**

## 7. Support **loading** component when Loading data that the tree needed

## 8. Adjust it's name when Panel that using the tree component resized.
