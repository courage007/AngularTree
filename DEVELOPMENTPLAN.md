# Ng2tree(an angular tree component) Manifesto
&nbsp;&nbsp;1 - Build a **Simple** and **Universal**  angular tree is No.1. What I want to do in the beginning is 
to create a simple and universal tree. In order to achieving the goal, I prefer to only add necessary
function. As we all know, if we improve the Universality, it will complicate the component.So I need to
find rebalance in Simplicity and Universality.

# Code Development Plan ( CDP )
&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop a much more perfact tree, I collect demand from other public angular tree and my 
colleagues who need to use an angular tree component.
What's more, I make a develop plan to coding in order which is helpful for anyone who want to use this 
tree component.
