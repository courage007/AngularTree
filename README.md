# Backgroud
  When my company prepared to develop a new deveop platform(software), I realised it is a good 
opportunity for me to open my Angular component. In this way, I can record my develop process and 
manage my project. What's more, it does well in someone wanting to learn how to develop an Angular
Component , or using a open-source Angular Tree Component.

# How Can I Used the Source Code
## 1. Download the Source Code
  This Project is Created by Angular CLI. I program this project by Visual Studio Code (**VS Code**).
## 2. Add node-modules Directory
  When we create a project using Angular CLI, Angular CLI will download basic Depencies like 
@angular, @ngtools. When uploaded my project to github, I found node-modules Directory has too many 
directories and files. Because of that, I choose do not upload node-modules Directory. So, if you want 
to run this project, you have to move a node-modules Directory from another Angular project created by
Anlular CLI.
## 3. Run this Project By Angular CLI
  In this step, you can use your experience in Angular CLI project to run or debug this Project.
